What would an MVP (minimum viable product) look like? If your team needed to ship features every evening to prove value to an investor, what would you work on and in what order?
-> A user needs to be able to create a vacation and invite other participants to join the vacation.
-> It needs to be able to display how much a participant owes for a vacation.
-> It needs to be able to invoice participants for the vacation.

What would set you apart during demo night?
-> An application that processes payments
-> Solves a real world problem/annoyance
-> It gives participants a clear view of the total payment owed for a single vacation, not only simplifies processing payments, but budgeting for a vacation as well.

What intimidates you but would be amazing to pull off?
-> Ideally our browser based web application will be mobile responsive so users can access on the go.
-> Allow participants to be responsible for more than one participant (ie: if a parent is on vacation with children)
-> Adding an additional feature that participants can add a secret budget for their vacation, and the app will notify them if they get close to that amount.
-> Multiple OAuth's
-> Track user data to inform future business decisions
-> Gamification
-> Upload receipts related to specific vacations/activities

How should your users experience the app? Desktop, mobile, native app?
-> Mobile responsive web application, users can access on desktop or mobile.

What features or technology choices would spark interesting discussions during job interviews?
-> Mobile friendly approach, responsive CSS
-> Creating an application that processes payments and focuses on security around payments

Would you use this product? If not, what is it missing?
-> Definitely, but it does need to achieve MVP in order for it to add value over other methods of splitting costs for a vacation.
