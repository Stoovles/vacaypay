(Meeting) Product Vision - Decide
Time Limit: 15-30 minutes
Objective: Decide what your minimum viable product is.
Assigned Roles
Time Enforcer: Chi
Notetaker: Jalena
Facilitator: Earl
Facilitator notes:

One way to quickly exhaust a group is to allow debates to go on too long. Have the team vote if any decision takes more than 10 minutes. If the team can’t decide bring in an instructor and they’ll be the deciding vote.

What are the three most important features?
The MVP is a browser based web application.
Feature 1: That a vacation owner can create a vacation, and invite participants to join
Feature 2: That a participant can see all of their vacations and the balance that they owe
Feature 3: That a participant can pay their balance
Feature 4: That an activity can be created with the user or any participant as the one who paid for it, and invoices will be routed correctly to the person that paid for the activity.

How would you prioritize them?
Feature 3, Feature 2, Feature 1, Feature 4
