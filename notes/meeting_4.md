Notetaker: Jalena
Facilitator: Chi
Facilitator notes:

Are there parts of the app that would benefit from things happening in the background? (tasks that take a long time or need to run on a regular basis; nightly, hourly, etc.)
-> Not that we can think of at this time.

Are there parts of the app that would benefit from breaking away from the request/response cycle by updating the page automatically? (websockets, AJAX, etc.)
-> When a vacation owner is adding/updating participants from their vacation show page, the page should update without refreshing.

Should you cache data to improve page load times?
-> Not that we can think of at this time.

Should this be one big Rails app?
-> Yes, at this time.

How might the schema look?
![schema]('Schema.png')

Is there anything different you might need to try in your schema? (self-referential associations, serialized columns, etc.)
-> Not at this time.
